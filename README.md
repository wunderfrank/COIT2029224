# COIT2029224
 The objective is to optimize the performance of a neural network model by applying Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning and to demonstrate its effectiveness over traditional methods such as manual tuning, grid search, or random search.

 Project Highlights
🔍 Problem Domain: [Specify your chosen domain here – e.g., image classification, time series forecasting, etc.]

🧪 Baseline Model: Traditional Neural Network implemented with standard hyperparameter optimization methods.

🌀 PSO Implementation: Applied PSO to optimize critical hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions.

📊 Performance Comparison: Evaluation of PSO-optimized model vs. traditionally tuned model using accuracy and efficiency metrics.

📈 Outcome: Demonstrated improvements in performance and training efficiency using PSO.
